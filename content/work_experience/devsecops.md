- Develop and maintained a test automation template for UI tests using the Selenium framework with Python, used Docker Compose to spin up containers of the Selenium Grid server to run the tests and used GitHub Actions to automate the entire CI/CD workflow. This reduces two-thirds of the runtime from the previous workflow.
- Assist in integrating new tools into a CI pipeline, most notably researching the possibility of using Resoto to visualise and warn spendings of AWS resources as dashboards to reduce costs of using similar tools such as AWS Systems Manager Inventory.
- Assist senior engineers and stakeholders with discovering and capturing business and technical requirements
