Lighting Tool coded in Python via the Maya API that adds a three-point lighting setup to an object, which includes a key light, fill light and back light. It can also add an L-shaped plane to the scene to reflect the lighting and adjust the colour of the back light. It will raise a specialised exception error if a back light is not selected to change colour. UI is coded in the PySide2 GUI framework.
